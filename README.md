Hello,

my name is thibault "something", i live in Lyon city in France.
I learned coding as an autodidact. My main langage is C99, i learned also Python, perl, bash, a bit of powershell, asm x86 on linux 64bits, php, html, css and i guess that's all.
I learned GTK2.0, Winapi32, and some softwares needed for exemple web dev like wamp (linux). I'am not sure the list is complet, but well no matter won't make the full list.
Best thing is to code projects and try to make them as best i can.

I coded quiet a lot of personnal projects. After managing in a quiet good way C99 i started to code network softwares, and then security ones, and to be honnest hack softs.
Most of them was deleted from my old github profil : Thibault-69, and never will be uploaded again, but of course they were forked so can be found. 
But hope people will take care with using them.

After a kind of black hole, i had to stop coding, but i will as soon as possible restart to make softwares, and my goal is to try to make counter-attack security softwares.
And will do my best for they will be usefull.

Take care.
